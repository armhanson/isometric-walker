# Isometric-ish Walker
An isometric-ish walking simulator.

### Description:

You've stumbled upon my side project, an isometric-ish walking sim!

### Getting Started:

I have a lot planned for this game, but for now, you get to watch me add pieces to it week by week.
Feel free to use any of the code snippets you find here.

If you want to use the code, [download and install Phaser.js 3](https://phaser.io/download "Phaser 3 Download Page").

Follow Phaser's [walkthrough](https://phaser.io/tutorials/getting-started-phaser3 "Phaser 3 Getting Started Tutorial"). Make sure you're using Phaser 3. My code won't work with v.2.

I recommend watching some extra tutorials [here](https://phaser.io/learn "Phaser's Learn Page").

### Execute!

You'll need to run the game on a local server through your browser.

I run the game locally by launching localHost in VS Code from inside the project's root folder.
It launches in Chrome and is playable immediately.

If it isn't launching properly, make sure you have both Phaser.js and Live Server installed properly.
